### Hi there, I'm [Jun Xiao (肖均)!](http://gwansiu.com/about/). 👋

**Note:** I am looking for some industrial positions about image/video analysis, machine learning and its applications in finance. I can work in Hong Kong without any sporsorship.

(Short bio): I am currently a postdoc fellow in the department of electronic and information engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research interests include machine learning (Bayesian and robust machine learning), image/video restoration and quality enhancement, and financial time series analysis. I received my PhD and MSc degree (with distinction) (supervised by [Prof. Kenneth K. M. Lam](http://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~enkmlam/)) from the department of electronic and information engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity, in 2022 and 2018, respectively. Before coming to the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity, I obtained my BSc degree from the Guangdong University of Technology, supervised by [Prof. Wing-Kuen Ling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OofKJWMAAAAJ&hl=en), in 2016.
