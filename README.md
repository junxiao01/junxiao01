### Hi there, I'm [Jun Xiao (肖均)!](http://gwansiu.com/about/). 👋


(Short bio): I am currently a postdoc fellow, supervised by Prof. Kin-Man Lam, in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

My research interests include image/video processing, restoration and enhancement (e.g., image/video super-resolution, image/video denoising, high dynamic range imaging, etc.), machine learning (e.g., bayesian machine learning, domain adaptation and generalization, robustness, etc.), deep generative models (e.g., diffusion models and flow matching), and AIGC-related topics.
